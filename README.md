## Work Experience
**Research Assistant @ The University of Wisconsin - Madison (_January 2023 - August 2023_)**
◦ Developed an optimization algorithm in Python to automatically align the mirrors of an optical cavity.
◦ Utilized Matplotlib and SciPy for simulation, assessing the impact of multi-dimensional mirror misalignment on the cavity beam output.
◦ Wrote and implemented an optimization algorithm to efficiently couple light between optical fibers.

**Research Assitant @ Indiana University - Bloomington (_January 2022 - May 2022_)**
◦ Constructed a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to stabilize the power of lasers necessary for quantum operations.
◦ Optimized quantum computing gates, reducing errors from power fluctuations by over 90 percent.

## Projects
### Effects on Modal Content in an Optical Cavity due to a General Misalignment, August 2023
[Report](https://github.com/louisfarenci/Portfolio/blob/main/Optical%20Cavity%20Misalignment%20Report.pdf)

Proposed a computational method for calculating the coupling strength of a fundamental Hermite-Gaussian beam to higher order modes in an optical cavity. Estimated a mode-dependent clipping of the beam intensity due to a sufficiently large misalignment
